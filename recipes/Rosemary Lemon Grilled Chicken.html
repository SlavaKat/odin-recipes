    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup butter</li>
      <li>½ cup fresh rosemary</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
      <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>6 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
      In a food processor, blend butter, rosemary, garlic, lemon zest, and
      lemon<br>
      juice together. Pour 1/3 of the blended mixture into a small bowl for<br>
      marinade. Cover remaining mixture, and set aside.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
      Lightly season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Rub chicken breasts
      with<br>
      marinade. Place chicken breasts on a platter, cover, and refrigerate for 3
      hours.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
      Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Transfer
      half of<br>the reserved rosemary and lemon mixture into a bowl for
      basting. Cover<br>remaining mixture, and set aside for topping cooked
      chicken.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
      Cook chicken breasts on hot grill, basting with rosemary and lemon
      basting<br>mixture, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted
      into<br>the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      Remove chicken<br>breasts from the grill, and top with remaining
      rosemary and lemon mixture.
